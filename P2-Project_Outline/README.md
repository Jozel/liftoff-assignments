### Overview
Have you ever been home on a Friday night and excited that is the weekend but have no idea where to go? Like most people you might be on a budget and would like to find a nearby place that are affordable and have good ambiance.  My project idea is called Tonight. My app helps the user find local places such as events, restaurants, lounges, bars and clubs that offer promotions such as happy hours, free admissions and free drinks. Regardless if the user is in the mood for just drinks and appetizers or if they want to make it all-night event. The app helps the user find places to have fun and not break the bank.

### Features
My application features user and promo your biss log in options.
•	The user log in features provide options to import your contacts and create groups. With the group features you can add or remove friends from a group and can notify or invite your friends if your planning to go to a certain event. The group option also allows a feature to check in with your location and this lets your group know you have arrived at the event. Another feature on the user log in is the option to save your favorite locations and share it with your contacts and members of your group.
